<h1>Thesis Project by Morgan Manning</h1>

<p>The information on this website will focus on the experience of Afro-Latinos in the United States.</p>

<p>Afro-Latinos in the United States are in an interesting position because even though they are Latino, many people view them as African American.</p>

<p>We will discover what an Afro-Latino is, the history of slavery in the Americas, the difference between race and ethnicity and facts and figures of Latinos in the United States. A documentary on this website will showcase three Afro-Latinos living in Miami and how they are dealing with their racial and ethnic identity.</p>

<h1>Participants in My Documentary</h1>

<p>A major component of my thesis is the documentary I shot, which is on the documentary page of my website.</p>

<p>Below are the pictures of the Afro-Latinos I interviewed with a short bio about who they are and what their profession is.</p>
