<h2>What is an Afro-Latino?</h2>

<p>An Afro-Latino is a person who claims to have African ancestry and is of Latino origin.
This means that this person is from any country in Latin America including Cuba, Brazil, Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic, for example, and identifies as a black person.</p>

<h2>Cultural Traditions</h2>

<p>The Afro-Latino culture has a big influence on Latino culture and many traditions that Afro-Latinos have created are widely accepted by other races in Latin America. Since the participants in my documentary are from Brazil, Puerto Rico and Cuba, I will be discussing the cultural traditions of black people in those countries.</p>

<p>Afro-Brazilians have created samba, which is a Brazilian dance and music genre. They have also created capoeira, which is a popular martial art. Candomble is a religion mainly practiced by Afro-Brazilians. Feijoada is dish with African inlfuences and is considered the national dish of Brazil. These are a few of the many traditions that Afro-Brazilians have contributed to Brazilian culture.</p>

<p>Afro-Cubans practice Santeria, which is a popular religion in Cuba with African influences. The musical and dance genre, rumba, was created by the African slaves in Cuba, which is influenced from the Efik and Efo tribes in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Afro-Puerto Ricans have influenced Puerto Rican culture greatly and even influenced how Puerto Ricans speak Spanish. Puerto Ricans don't use the R and S sound when they speak. The R and S sounds are not used in African languages so Puerto Ricans speak the way Africans would.</p>

<p>Puerto Rican food with African influences include arroz con gandules, plantanos and sancocho. The bomba and plena are Puerto Rican music genres with African influences.</p>
