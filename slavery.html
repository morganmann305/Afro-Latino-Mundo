<h1>Atlantic Slave Trade</h1>

<p>The Atlantic Slave Trade lasted from around 1526 to 1867. 10.7 million African slaves came to the Americas.</p>

<p>Africans who were shipped to Brazil are usually from the country of Angola, which is in the southern part of Africa. Africans who went to North America and the Caribbean came primarily from West Africa.</p>

<p>Over 90 percent of Africans were shipped to Latin America while around only 6 percent were sent to the United States. This statistic shows that the majority of the African descendants of the Atlantic Slave Trade are in Latin America.</p>

<h1>Sugar Crop</h1>

<p>Slaves in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean and Brazil, mostly worked on sugar plantations.</p>

<p>Sugar was a major export for Latin America to different countries and the slaveowners would make their slaves plant and harvest the sugarcane. Field slaves would cut the sugarcane and move it to a mill where the juices were extracted.</p>

<p>There were slaves who worked in factories and would process the sugarcane to become sugar or rum.</p>
